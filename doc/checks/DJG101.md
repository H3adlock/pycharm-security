# DJG101

Use of `RawSQL` cursor with quoted parameters will expose the query to SQL injection.

Whilst the RawSQL method support parametrized queries, if the `%s` value is quoted with single-quotes, the value is still vulnerable to SQL injection.

## Example

```python
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL
...


queryset.annotate(val=RawSQL("select col from sometable where othercol = '%s'", (someparam,)))
```

## Fixes

Remove the quotations from the string values.
