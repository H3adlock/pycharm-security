# RQ100

Setting verify=False when using requests bypasses SSL verification and leaves requests susceptible to MITM attacks.

## Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(url, verify=False)
```

## Fixes

Leave SSL verification enabled. If you want it disabled for local testing and development purposes, consider a self-signed certificate
