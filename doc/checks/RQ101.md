# RQ101

Setting verify=False when using httpx bypasses SSL verification and leaves requests susceptible to MITM attacks.

## Example

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get(url, verify=False)
```

## Fixes

Leave SSL verification enabled. If you want it disabled for local testing and development purposes, consider a self-signed certificate
