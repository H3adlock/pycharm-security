# DJG100

Running Django in Debug mode is not recommended and should only be used for local development purposes.

Debug mode will expose information that can be useful to attackers, such as paths, user details, environment settings, operating system versions.

This check will only look at files named `settings.py`.

## Example

```python
# settings.py
DEBUG = True
```
