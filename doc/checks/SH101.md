# SH101

Call to risky spawned process function.

This is a **weak warning**, to add additional verification. If this warning was raised within a 3rd party library, check the parameters.

## APIs

Python has many ways to execute local commands, either as a process or using a shell.

This check will look for:
`os.execl`, `os.execle`, `os.execlp`, `os.execlpe`, `os.execv`, `os.execve`, `os.execvp`, `os.execvpe`,
        `os.spawnl`, `os.spawnle`, `os.spawnlp`, `os.spawnlpe`, `os.spawnv`, `os.spawnve`, `os.spawnvp`, `os.spawnvpe`
