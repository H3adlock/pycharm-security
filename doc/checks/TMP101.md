# TMP101

Using a hardcoded path to read or write temporary files is insecure and leaves it open to attackers replacing the file contents. 

## Example

```python
with open('/tmp/my_app', 'w') as tmp_file:
    tmp_file.write('data')
```

## Fixes

* Use `tempfile.mkstemp()` or another standard library function for generating temporary file names
