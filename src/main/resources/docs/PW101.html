<h1>PW101</h1>
<p>Passwords, secrets and keys should not be hardcoded into Python files.</p>
<p>Python can easily be disassembled in memory and strings can be loaded.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><code>python
password = &quot;SUPER_SECRET&quot;
</code></p>
<p><code>python
secret = &quot;my super secret key&quot;
</code></p>
<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>Use a salted or one-way hash for storing passwords and compare against the hash.</p>
